NY Flight Delay Predictions

Topic / Question / Problem
Investigate the factors influencing flight delays in New York (Using Rstudio).

Research Aims & Sub-questions
1. Evaluate Airline On-Time Performance
• Which airlines have the highest and lowest average delay times, and how do they compare over different
time periods?
• Which airlines have the highest and lowest probability of delay?
2. Analyze Key Factors Influencing Flight Delays
• What role do weather conditions (wind speed, precipitation, temperature) play in predicting flight
delays?
• How does the time of day and seasonality impact the frequency and severity of flight delays?
• Do specific origin and destination airports contribute to longer flight delays, and what factors might
explain these variations?
3. Develop Predictive Models for Flight Delays
• Can machine learning models effectively predict whether a flight will be delayed, and which variables
contribute most to these predictions?
